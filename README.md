# Life in Weeks

> The days are long, but the years are short.

A Chrome extension that transforms your new tab page into a powerful visual reminder of your time on Earth. Every time you open a new tab, you'll see your entire life displayed as a grid of weeks — each box representing one week of your life.

## 🎯 The Philosophy

This extension is inspired by the iconic [Wait But Why post on "Your Life in Weeks"](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html).

The idea is simple but profound: when you see your entire life as a finite grid of boxes, time stops feeling infinite. Those empty boxes aren't just future weeks — they're opportunities waiting to be filled.

**The green boxes?** Those are behind you.  
**The faded blue boxes?** Those are ahead.  
**That one bright box?** That's *this* week. Make it count.
